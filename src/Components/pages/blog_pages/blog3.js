Mentorship Proposal
</h1>

<h5 className="blog-date">

<p className="blog-content">

I am writing this blogpost as a mentorship proposal, asking marmar111 from discord to be my mentor. My expectations from this mentor-mentee relationship is to
to help me gauge my skill level and to learn from marmar111 how to be an actual software developer. While I have in the past worked on a number of projects, they don't seem
to reflect the level of programming experience. I hope marmar111 will not only help me understand where I stand as a developer but also will help me have a better approach towards
applying for a software dev position. The end goal of this mentor-mentee relationship is for me to be able to successfully become a fulltime software developer. I hope I am not asking
for much. Looking forward to work with marmar111 in the coming months. Also, thanks for doing this.
