White Hat Jr. May End up Doing More Harm Than Good
</h1>

Recently there has been a lot of buzz around for this new startup called White Hat Jr.
For those who don't know, it is an online programming teaching platform aimed at children 
from ages 6 to 18. On the surface, it seems harmless. What bad can come out of teaching children 
how to code. The problem I have is not that children shouldn't learn how to code. As a former child,
I am all for teaching children as young as 6 how to code. After all, all the pioneers of their fields started
young and if we want to see similar success in India then it should be promoted. The problem is that the product
isn't meant for children. It may look like it is directed towards them but you have to realise that
preteens aren't interested in programming that much. The key to developing interest in programming and computers, in
general, doesn't lie in some online programming bootcamp. It is supposed to come naturally. Introduce them to it. You don't
need to sign up for things like White Hat Jr. for it and see if they have an interest. If they do show an interest then sure go on and do whatever
you have to do get them started in the right direction but if not then for the love of god please stop. Don't shove it down their
throats. No pioneers will come out of it and what you'll get at best is another engineer who can slave away for FAANG. As I said
earlier, the consumers aren't the kids. It is the parents of the said kids. These parents have been made to believe that programmer is
the greatest career option right now and rightfully so. I am not going to pretend that programmers don't make an absolute bank and us
as a society has emphasised the value of a "great career" over anything else as far as I can remember. Imagine a businessman selling
"how to extract gold for kids" in 19th century America. This is exactly what companies like White Hat Jr. and others in the same league 
are trying to achieve. They are in no way meant to help kids develop their interest in computer science but is rather trying to cash in 
on the insecurities that Indian parents have. Maybe they aren't financially well off and see their kids as means to get out of there dire
financial state or maybe parents are looking for some "second-hand glory" because of some unrealised dreams of theirs'. And you can't blame parents 
for them either, they went through the same things. They don't know any better. This is the same reason why engineering and medicine
have become the defacto career options for Indians not only in India but around the world. This need for validation among parents is so strong that
you just have to look at any National Spelling Bee Championship in the US to understand the seriousness of the problem. Kids on stage with no enthusiasm
whatsoever, nervous to the point that one kid fainted on the stage. I guess the fear of punishment was more and that is why he got up
and gave the right answer. His fear of punishment came over death as a comedian once said. Coming back to the topic, this obsession over "kids should know" programming
doesn't seem like the idea that puts a kid's well being at the centre. It seems like the transaction is happening between these EdTech startups and the parents without
the kids having any say in it. Also, the product itself feels a little deceptive because to be a tutor on the platform you <a href="https://www.whitehatjr.com/teacher" className="blog-hyperlinks">don't even need to be a programmer in the
first place.</a> How am I supposed to believe that the tutor will teach the kid with utmost passion for the craft when they themselves have had at max. a year worth of more
experience than the student (I don't know how long they train their tutors but a year seems like a reasonable guess).

If all of the above sounds similar it is because my generation went through the same thing but with coaching institutes. I have personally had the freedom to 
pick whatever I wanted to study but a lot of the people around me didn't have the same choice. And we all know what has that resulted to, where <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/dec/27/kota-toll-rising-each-year-1916935.html" className="blog-hyperlinks">
19 students 
commited suicide in the year 2018.</a> Now, with these EdTech startups the outcomes may not be the same but they do operate on the same principle of selling the 
glory of a highly paid career to parents who don't know any better. I just hope this time around with all the information available on the Internet, parents will
realise that there are better ways of raising their kids and will help their kids develop their interests and that if their kids do end up showing interest in programming,
they <a href="https://edu.google.com/code-with-google/?modal_active=none&story-card_activeEl=enhance-any-subject" className="blog-hyperlinks">don't have to pay for programming lessons.</a>
</p>
<p className="blog-content" style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>
P.S.: I like countless other programmers made this website without ever paying a rupee for coding lessons.
