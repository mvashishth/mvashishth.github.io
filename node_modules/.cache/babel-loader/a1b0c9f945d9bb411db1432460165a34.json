On the surface, it seems harmless. What bad can come out of teaching children how to code. The problem I have is not that children shouldn't learn how to code. As a former child, I am all for teaching children as young as 6 how to code. After all, all the pioneers of their fields started young and if we want to see similar success in India then it should be promoted. The problem is that the product isn't meant for children. It may look like it is directed towards them but you have to realise that preteens aren't interested in programming that much. The key to developing interest in programming and computers, in general, doesn't lie in some online programming bootcamp. It is supposed to come naturally. Introduce them to it. You don't need to sign up for things like White Hat Jr. for it and see if they have an interest. If they do show an interest then sure go on and do whatever you have to do get them started in the right direction but if not then for the love of god please stop. Don't shove it down their throats. No pioneers will come out of it and what you'll get at best is another engineer who can slave away for FAANG. As I said earlier, the consumers aren't the kids. It is the parents of the said kids. These parents have been made to believe that programmer is the greatest career option right now and rightfully so. I am not going to pretend that programmers don't make an absolute bank and us as a society has emphasised the value of a \\\"great career\\\" over anything else as far as I can remember. Imagine a businessman selling \\\"how to extract gold for kids\\\" in 19th century America. This is exactly what companies like White Hat Jr. and others in the same league are trying to achieve. They are in no way meant to help kids develop their interest in computer science but is rather trying to cash in on the insecurities that Indian parents have. Maybe they aren't financially well off and see their kids as means to get out of there dire financial state or maybe parents are looking for some \\\"second-hand glory\\\" because of some unrealised dreams of theirs'. And you can't blame parents for them either, they went through the same things. They don't know any better. This is the same reason why engineering and medicine have become the defacto career options for Indians not only in India but around the world.
